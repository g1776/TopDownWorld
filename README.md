# World Editor

Gregory Glatzer

Based on the [YouTube tutorial by Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iHejdqYIa8&t=10233s)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g typescript
tsc -w
# open index.html in browser
```

## Improvements made by me

-   Written in TypeScript
-   Made more well-defined classes for the different types of objects along with interfaces.
-   Centralized all default values and other settings in a single file: `settings.ts`
-   Randomized building sizes
-   Added a styled app bar
